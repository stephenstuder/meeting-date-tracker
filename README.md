# meeting-date-tracker
Portfolio project/ Project to help my fiance with her job

## About This
So if you've made it this far back you are going to see these fragmented projects. These are the points at which i was learning git/github/building projects from scratch. Not to say these are the beginning of my experience. I had just only worked on existing codebases at work through SVN. So this way of coding was relatively newer to me. The need for this app is no longer there, Makenna has found an easy way to track her meeting dates. But i will leave this here as a little reminder of where i started out.
